# Spring Onion Pancakes

## Ingredients

- 1 bunch of spring onions (about 6)
- 400g Flour
- 280 Water
- Oil
- Salt
- White sesame seed (optional)

## Steps

- Combine flour and cold water, knead for about 20 minutes, until it doesn't feel wet and sticky anymore.
- Split the dough into three balls, cover them with a wet towel and wait for 20 minutes.
- In the meantime cut the bunch of spring onions into thin rings. If the spring onions are too thick, half or quarter them first.
- Use a dough roller to flatten a ball into a 2mm thick pancake.
- Sprinkle quite some salt, about half a teaspoon per pancake, and roll it into the dough.
- Cover with a generous amount of oil.
- Spread the spring onions all over the pancake.
- Roll it into a thin long tube and close the two ends.
- From the middle start twisting with two hands into the opposite direction, continue until you reach the left and right ends.
- Roll it like a turd ðŸ’©, cover them with a wet towel and wait for 20 minutes.
- Use a dough roller to flatten a ball into 5mm thick pancake, about 20-25 centimeters in diameter (and optionally add some white sesame seeds).
- Heat the pan on a medium heat, and fry both sides of the pancake until they're golden brown.
- Drizzle a copious amount of oil, about three tablespoons, around the edges of the pancake and shake the pan to have the oil get under the edges of the pancake.
- Repeat for the other side of the pancake.
